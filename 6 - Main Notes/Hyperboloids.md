# Hyperboloids
Hyperboloids can either have one "sheet" or two sheets, where by sheets we mean how many distinct parts there are. If there are two sheets then there will be a gap in graph and if not it will be one connected part.

**One sheet:**
$$(\frac{x}{a})^2 + (\frac{y}{b})^2 =(\frac{z}{c})^2+1$$
**Two Sheets:**
$$(\frac{x}{a})^2 + (\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2-1$$
**Elliptic Cone:**
$$(\frac{x}{a})^2 + (\frac{y}{b})^2=(\frac{z}{c})^2$$
An elliptic cone is where you have a hyperboloid with two "sheets" but they touch exactly once. Essentially the amount you add or subtract is equal to the "distance" between the two, with distance in quotations because of how one sheet hyperboloids work.
