NoSQL databases are often used for [[Semi-Structured Data]] and [[Unstructured Data]], and works around flexible formats (CSV, JSON, XML). 

**Types**
- Document stores
- Key-value stores, this is where we store a bunch of data that is associated with a specific key for fast retrieval. The values associated can be a bunch of different things or arrays. It's super fast but the catch is that there's limited queries.
- Graph databases
- Columnar databases
