# Properties applying to Assertions

**Four Fundamental functions of an Utterance**
- Factual Information
- Self Revelation; discloses some information about the speaker
- Appeal; Something is said to prompt the other party to do or believe something
- Relationship; Says something about your relationship to the listener

Interesting Concept: "when someone says something to you, the only thing you can know for certain is that they wanted to be heard saying it"

**Idea based on the Grice Principles?**
- Speaker intends for the hearer to consider P, they introduce it as relevant
- Speaker believes (or presents as believing) P.
- Speaker believes P is not already in the common ground.
- Speaker believes they are in a position to assert P; they have enough evidence, standing, or contextual authority.
