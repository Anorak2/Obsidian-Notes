# Software Metrics
A metric is a measurement of the degree to which a property is present in a software system / posses some property. Often metric is used as a synonym to a measurement.

1. Quantitative: Metrics must possess a quantitative nature. It means metrics can be expressed in numerical values.
2. Understandable: Metric computation should be easily understood, and the method of computing metrics should be clearly defined.
3. Applicability: Metrics should be applicable in the initial phases of the development of the software.
4. Repeatable: When measured repeatedly, the metric values should be the same and consistent.
5. Economical: The computation of metrics should be economical, though where the line is drawn is subjective
6. Language Independent: Metrics should not depend on any programming language.

**Metric Types:**
1. Product Metrics: used to evaluate the state of the product and identify risks or potential problem areas. Ex, lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, etc.
2. Process Metrics: These metrics relate to the long term process of the team or organization and used to optimize the development process and maintenance activities of software. Examples include the defect injection rate and the effort variance, the difference between expected and actual work for a task.
3. Project Metrics: The project metrics describes the characteristic and execution of a project. Examples include effort estimation accuracy, schedule deviation, cost variance, and productivity. Usually measures the number of software developer staffing patterns over the life cycle of software, cost, and schedule productivity

**Limitations:**
Since software development is complex it can be difficult to define or measure software qualities, see rice's theorem lol, especially when trying to define metrics before the design. It's also debated which metrics actually matter, and if they do matter what do they mean. Because of these limitations the scope is often limited to the following:
-   Scheduling
-   Software sizing
-   Programming complexity
-   Software development effort estimation
-   Software quality
Something else worth mentioning is that simple metrics can cause more harm than good if taken too seriously, for example that bozo elon musk considering only lines of code is a perfect example.
