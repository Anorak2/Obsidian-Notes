When we're talking about multi-variable limits, when we say 
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L$$
this means that as x approaches a, and as y approaches b, the function f(x,y) means we can get as close to L as we want by making (x,y) closer to (a,b). This is pretty similar to [[Limit definition|2d limits]], and most of the same [[Basic Limit Laws]] still hold however we can no longer use direct substitution, this is because we have to examine every single possible path towards a point and make sure they all agree.

Since we have to make every curve agree, what we can do to work around it is use [[Polar Coordinates]], since we can convert to polar and then try to rearrange the function to factor out $\theta$ which means the angle of our approach doesn't matter
