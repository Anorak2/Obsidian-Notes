# Evolution of Operating Systems
**Batch Systems**
Every user submits their job on punch cards and the system collects a batch of jobs, and then reads the batch before processing starts. The computer can only handle on job at a time, and the problem is that the CPU is underutilized to wait on I/O operations and there is no interactivity.

**Multi-programming**
By running multiple jobs at a time the I/O and compute can overlap and now the goal is to maximize the system's throughput.

**Time Sharing**
This is when we have multiple interactive users sharing one machine where each user can access the machine via a terminal. Each user interacts as if they were the only person using the machine. Here the goal changes to optimize the response time.
