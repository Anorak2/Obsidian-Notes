instead of using x and y as the coordinates, we use r and $\theta$ with $\theta$ being the angle and r being the distance from 0. 

We can covert from polar coordinates and x,y coordinates by using sin and cos, ex $\frac{x}{r} = Cos \theta$ which in practice looks like:

$x = r Cos\theta$
$y = rSin\theta$

and

$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
$tan(\theta)=\frac{y}{x}$
