**DEFINITION**
$$Cov[G,H] = \sigma_{GH}= E[(G-\mu_g)(H-\mu_H)] $$
OR
$$Cov[G,H] = \sigma_{GH} = E[GH] - \mu_G \space \mu_H$$

While [[Variance and ST Deviation|variance]] is always positive, covariance can be positive, negative, or 0.

**WHAT COVARIANCE TELLS US**
If ($G \space \mu_G$) and ($H \space \mu_H$) have the same sign, then the product will be positive. Otherwise the product will be negative. This means that the sign of $\sigma_{GH}$ gives us info about the tendency of G and H to be on the same side of their means ($\sigma_{GH} > 0$) or on opposite sides. In general, a large/smaller magnitude of $\sigma_{GH}$ indicates that G or H tend to be further/closer to their means

We have to be careful though because covariance largely depends on the units
