**PROPERTIES**
- Te Sum/Integral of joint PMF/PDF over all variable values is 1
- The probability of Event E is the Sum/Integral over all outcomes in E
- You find the "marginal" PDF/PMF of any subset of RVs by summing/integrating out all the other RVs
- All of the individual RVs are independent iff the joint PMF/PDF is the product of all individual marginals
- The RVs are identically distributed if they all have the same marginal PMF/PDF

RVs that are both independent and identically distributed are designated iid
