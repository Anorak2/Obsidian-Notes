# Power rule
The power rule is probably the most fundamental [[Derivatives]] rule, it says that we can find the derivative of a function by doing

$$f(x)= x^2+x+5$$
$$f'(x) = 2x +1$$
what is going on here, is we are multiplying the variable by it's power, and then subtracting one from it's exponent which looks like $x^2 \to 2x^2 \to 2x^1$. If we are differentiating a constant it turns into zero, this makes intuitive sense since a [[Derivatives|derivative]] represents the rate of change and a constant doesn't change.
