# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's game of life was invented by John Conway and is a game designed around building cellular automata that interact using simple, deterministic behavior. What makes Conway's game of life interesting is the way simple machines can balloon to a surprising level of complexity, Conway's game of life is also notably Turing complete and as a result many interesting machines have been created.

**Rules for a cell surviving**
1. Any live cell with < 2 neighbors dies
2. any live cell with 2-3 neighbors lives
3. Any live with > 3 neighbors dies
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes a live cell
