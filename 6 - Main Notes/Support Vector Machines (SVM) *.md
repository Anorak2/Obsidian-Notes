# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A SVM is a linear separator that identifies a hyperplane to separate two classes. What this looks like in practice is if we have a 2d plane with a series of points, each belonging to one of two classes, how can we best draw a line so that they are split into two groups. What is nice is that this method works well in theory and in practice, and it blends techniques from many sources
- Training Instance x ∈ℝ d and y ∈{−1 ,1 }
- Model Parameters w ∈ℝ d and b∈ℝ

We also must assume that there is some level of noise to prevent a solution from being too tightly fitted to the training data. The larger the noise the fewer possible hyperplanes, and the larger the noise the lower the training error. 

**VS Logistic Regression**: Instead of considering all values just consider the boundary values and create the largest margin from both sets of points.
