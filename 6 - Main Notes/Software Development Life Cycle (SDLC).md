# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


## Testing Types:
Common SDLC has the problem where testing occurs only at the very end, which can be problematic. We can help fix this with Software Quality Analysis (SQA) which focuses on the entire SDLC and is proactive rather than reactive.

**Formal Verification** uses mathematical proofs to rigorously prove correctness for all cases without testing being necessary. This process is complex and expensive, and therefore only really used in safety critical systems or for very critical pieces of software (you may formally prove the validity of a compiler for example)

**Test Driven development** is the process of writing a representative test case that fails first, and then writing the code to pass the test case afterwards

**Pair Programming** is where there are two developers on the same keyboard and one does the micro and one does the macro
