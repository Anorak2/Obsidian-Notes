# Partial Derivatives
Partial derivatives are very very similar to normal derivatives, many other derivative techniques apply. The main difference is that for a partial, we choose a single variable to act as a variable, and we treat everything else (including other variables) as constants

**Clairaut's Theorem**
This theorem states that if $f_{xy}(x,y)$ and $f_{yx}(x,y)$ are continuous then the two are equivalent to each other.
