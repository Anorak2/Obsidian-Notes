here we take an argument of form $P\to Q$ and we then negate both sides to get $\neg P\to \neg Q$ which hopefully will simplify things, after this we can use a [[Direct proofs|direct proof]]  or some other technique

This works because the two statements $P \to Q$ and $\neg P \to \neg Q$ are logically equivalent
