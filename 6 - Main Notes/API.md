# API

An application programming interface is a type of software interface offering a service to other pieces of software, and unlike a user interface it is designed specifically for software to software connection.

#### Categories
1. Libraries, a pretty basic one by calling to the library you can use it as a black box to provide certain functionality without having to go through a possible lengthy implementation
2. Frameworks: Unlike a library or a standard application the overall flow of control isn't controlled by the caller but by the framework. The framework's code can't be modified, and is actually kind of like Platform as a Service, users can extend the framework but not modify its code.
3. Operating Systems: An API can specify the interface between an operating system and a program.
4. Remote APIs: Remote APIs allow for developers to manage resources remotely, this can also be done using all sorts of standards or technologies but it should allow for things to work together regardless
5. Web APIs: The type of interface between a company and people using their assets, some examples would be Twitter or Alexa offering an interface
