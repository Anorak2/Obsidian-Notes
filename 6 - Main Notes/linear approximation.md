# linear approximation
Since derivatives are useful for measuring the rate of change over time we can also use derivatives to locally approximate a complex function. Linear functions are easier to work with and easier to compute and as such can have some applications.


Single variable Linear approximation, note this is the the same way we find the tangent line.
$$y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$
Two variable linear approximation:
$$f(x,y)=f(a,b) +f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$
