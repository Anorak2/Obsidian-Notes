**Forward Reasoning**
First try a [[Direct proofs|direct method of proof]], and if that doesn't work then try an indirect method of proof such as [[Proof by Contradiction|contradiction]] or [[Proof by Contraposition|contraposition]]. 

First try forward reasoning. Start with the axioms and known theorems and construct a sequence of steps that end in the conclusion.

**Backwards Reasoning**
If this doesn’t work, try backward reasoning. When trying to prove q, find a statement p that we can prove with the  property p → q
