# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is another [[Formal Sorting Definition|sorting algorithm]] that works by maintaining a sorted section and adding from the input to that sorted section until finished.


**Strategy**
- Start with an empty output 
- iterate through the input and insert into the output in the correct position

In practice we use an in place insertion sort, designating the left most section as the sorted portion and swapping items.
