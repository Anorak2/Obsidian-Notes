When we are talking about what a graph does as $x \to \infty$ is we are talking about [[Limit definition|limits]]. And a limit in this situation will do a couple of things, it will converge to a constant L, or it will not converge and go to positive or negative infinity. In the first case think of Asymptotes. If we have an asymptote f(x) who's limit is equal to 5, what that means is we can make f(x) as close to 5 as we like by just making x larger.
