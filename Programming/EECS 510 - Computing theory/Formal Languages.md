[[Theory of Computing]]

We defined a language as "a set of strings with some inherent structure used to express a computation" in [[basic definitions]]. We define a formal language as a set of strings formed with symbols from some finite alphabet.

When we study formal languages we are interested in how symbols may be combined to validly form strings.

**Example Alphabet:**
$$\Sigma = \{a,b\}$$
Some strings we can construct
$$abba$$

$$abbababb$$
We can choose any amount we want or chose nothing which results in the empty string "" or $\lambda$

We can define a set called the **Kleene Star**, which we will always denote it with as star such as $\Sigma^*$ ,which is an infinite list in canonical order
$$\Sigma^* = \{\lambda, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, ...\}$$

A formal language is a subset of its alphabets Kleene Star
