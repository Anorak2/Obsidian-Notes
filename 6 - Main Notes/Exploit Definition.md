# Exploit Definition
Pieces of software, chunks of data, or sequences of commands that take advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability. The goal is usually to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on a computerized system.
Examples include gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or causing a denial-of-service.

Remote exploits
- work over a network do not require any prior access to the vulnerable system

Local exploits
- require prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator
