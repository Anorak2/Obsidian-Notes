Matrix multiplication is defined where 
$$AB =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}
u & v \\
w & x \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
if we have these two matrices times each other, to find a value in the resulting array we "combine" the nth row in A and mth column in B. We do this by multiplying each value by the corresponding value in the other array and then adding these all up together. For example the top left value of the resulting array would be $a*u+b*w$.
