# U/V method
$$ \int u \space dv= uv - \int v \space du$$
I mean it's the u/v method, when doing this make sure you make "similar" choices.  What I mean is if you use something as the derivative, keep doing that otherwise things may break.

# Trig Substitution
$$\sec^2\theta = \tan^2\theta+1$$ $$\sin^2\theta = 1-\cos^2\theta$$ $$\tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta-1$$ 
with these forms we can substitute in a trig function in the same way where we would sub something in with u sub.
