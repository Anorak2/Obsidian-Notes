Two RVs are independent iff the joint PMF/PDF is the product of the marginals

**PROPERTIES IF TWO VARS ARE INDEPENDENT**
For any functions $f_1$ and $f_2$, $E[f_1(G)f_2(h)] = E[f_1(g)] \cdot E[f_2(h)]$

G and H are uncorrelated, keep in mind independent implies uncorrelated but uncorrelated does not imply independence
