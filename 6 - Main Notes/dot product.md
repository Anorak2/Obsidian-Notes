# dot product
The dot product of two [[Vector Definition|vectors]] $a = \lt a_1, a_2, a_3 \gt$ and $b = \lt b_1, b_2, b_3 \gt$ is equal to 

$$a \cdot b = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3$$
the dot product is commutative and can distribute across [[Vector Algebra |vector addition]], furthermore $a \cdot a = |a|^2$

#### theorem 2
if $\theta$ is the angle between two vectors then 
$$a \cdot b = |a||b|\cos \theta$$
#### Perpendicular / Orthognal 
a and b are perpendicular if and only if $a \cdot b = 0$
