# Concavity
there's only four types, it can be increasing or decreasing and then it can be either concave up or down.

concave down has curve below the tangent line


# Second Derivative test
if $f''$ is continuous near c and $f'(c)$ = 0

1. if $f''(c) < 0$, then (c,f(c)) is a local maximum
2. if $f''(c) > 0$, then (c,f(c)) is a local minimum
3. if the second derivative is 0 then we can't tell anything
