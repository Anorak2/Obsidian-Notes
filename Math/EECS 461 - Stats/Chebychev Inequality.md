This inequality is based on the [[Markov Inequality]] but it is much more useful. This is in part since the Chebychev is generally a tighter bound than the Markov, but what's interesting is that it requires both the mean and variance of Y 

for an arbitrary random variable Y and constant c > 0
$$P[|Y-\mu_Y| \geq c] \leq \frac{Var[Y]}{c^2}$$
