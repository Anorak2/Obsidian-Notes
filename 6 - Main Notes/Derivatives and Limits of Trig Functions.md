# Derivatives and Limits of Trig Functions
Key Limits are listed below, these limits will show up all the time for a number of reasons and can also be seen in a variety of different forms.

$$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{sin(x)}{x}=1$$
$$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{1-cos(x)}{x}=0$$
###  Common Alternate Forms:

$$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{sin(x)}=1$$
$$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{cos(x)-1}{x}=0$$
$$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{-(cos(x)-1)}{x}=0$$

## Derivative of sin/cos
$$\frac{d}{dx}(sin(x))=cos(x)$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(cos(x))=-sin(x)$$
These two in particular are very important because you can derive the composition of other functions using these two in case you forget the rule.
