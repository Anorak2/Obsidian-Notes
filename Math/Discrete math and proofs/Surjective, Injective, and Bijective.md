#### Injective
We say that $f$ is a one to one map, if for $x_1, x_2 \in X$, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$

we also call this one to one

#### Surjective
we say $f$ is surjective if for each $y \in Y$ there is an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$


#### Bijective

We say that a function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective
