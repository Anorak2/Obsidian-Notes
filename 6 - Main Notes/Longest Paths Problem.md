# Longest Paths Problem

The problem is that say we have a weighted [[Graphs|graph]], that can be directed, how do we find the longest path tree from S to every other vertex. The path must also be simple which means no cycles are allowed.

This is currently an open problem since as of right now the best known algorithm is exponential, although there is a special case for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). According to Prof. Yao this is one of the most important open problems to solve, and also very difficult to actually solve.
