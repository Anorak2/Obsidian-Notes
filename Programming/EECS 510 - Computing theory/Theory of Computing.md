types:
- Complexity theory - what makes problems computationally hard and others easy
- Computability Theory - what problems are solvable
- Automata Theory - deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation
	- Finite automata is one model
		they are used for text processing, compilers, and hardware design
	- Another type is context free grammar
		this allows us to generate strings and they are used a lot in programming and in AI
