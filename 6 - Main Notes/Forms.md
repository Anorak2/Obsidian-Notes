# Forms

Forms can have a lot of data types associated with them, strings, boolean, reference, geolocation data was also in the work. There are a couple ways to configure forms, whether using the form design or form layout tools. These tools are kinda cool, and allow us to obviously design forms but also create new fields inside of the tools

**Form Design**
This is a kind of drag and drop solution that shows you basically exactly what the form will look like when you are done

**Form Layout**
This is a field collector/slush bucket kind of solution that is actually more powerful than form design.

**Personalize**
As with many other things we can personalize a form in order for only certain fields to be shown

**Templates**
In a workspace you can create a new template for forms with field values etc and these can be made available for certain groups.
