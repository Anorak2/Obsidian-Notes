A square matrix of size $n*m$ is called an elementary matrix if it can be obtained from [[The Identity Matrix]] by using only a single elementary row operation.

The elementary row operations are:
- Swapping the position of two rows on $I_n$
- multiplying a row of $I_n$ by a scalar where that scalar does not equal 0
- Adding a scalar multiple of a row to another row

### Properties
If a matrix E is elementary then $E^{-1}$ exists and is also elementary. 

Any operation you do to $I_n$ to form an elementary matrix, $EA$ is equal to doing that same operation on A.
