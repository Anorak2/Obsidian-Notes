Area is preserved by cutting regions into pieces and by rotating pieces however you want. 

# Area under Curve:
if we are looking at a 2d graph and the area between a function and say the x axis we can approximate this area using n number of rectangles. We first split up the area into n segments of length $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$. We then pick a point somewhere within each bin and set the height of the rectangle to that.

from there we just multiply the height of each bin by $\Delta x$

**Three points to usually check from:**
* left hand side
* middle
* right hand side

# Area expressed as a limit
the area A under the graph can be expressed using n rectangles and as n gets larger and larger the approximation $R_n$ gets better and better. The exact area can be given by taking a limit of $R_n$ as n goes to infinity.
