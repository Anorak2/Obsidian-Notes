$$f'(x)=\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\lim\limits_{x \to a} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$
This is the limit definition of a derivative, and it represents the instantaneous rate of change for a function. Another way to express this is if we are looking at a polynomial, say $x^2-7x+9$, then it's derivative, $2x-7$, is a tangent line that will touch the graph exactly once.

# Notations for derivatives

### Lagrange:
y' = f'(x)
### Leibniz
$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx}$
### Higher Derivatives
$f''(x), f'''(x), f^{(n)}(x)$

$$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$$
