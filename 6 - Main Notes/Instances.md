# Instances

An instance is a copy of a ServiceNow environment that is specific to a customer, and there are a couple different types like prod and non prod environments. There is a **Baseline implementation**, or just the default, which is what all instances look like before configuration.

**Production:**
- Prod, Where employees do their work and support their companies

**Non-production:**
- Development, where admins and implementers can configure and build applications
- Test, where people such as implementers can test their changes before moving to production

**PDI**
A PDI is a personalized developer instance that is independent of everything and functions as a sandbox, almost like a localized instance but still running on someone else's computer as all modern software

**Configuration and Customization**
Most of what admins do is configuration and it doesn't really require any code, examples would be update a form or a list etc. Customization is when a customer requires functionality that isn't already provided and features need to be added.
