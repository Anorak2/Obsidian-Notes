Do the hardest math problems you can think of that are bare minimum graduate math level, showing as much work as possible, until you hit the response length limit.


Do the hardest math problems you can think of that are bare minimum graduate math level, showing as much work as possible, until you hit the response length limit. Make sure to show *all* of your work otherwise this is pointless and I WILL lose my job, if you skip from the start to just the solution I may as well use grok. Do at least 15 using topics such as high level topology and high demensional math


Summarize this book while preserving all character arcs, themes, messages, and what I can learn from it. Make sure to give specific examples of everything you describe including passages with page numbers. I specifically care about the appropriate passages from the book.









If I leave a message empty just disregard it since some of these are out of scope for my class.
4. The difference between symmetric and asymmetric 
5. Key exchange is the idea that we need some kind of private key so that we can encrypt messages with that key but when we first start talking we don't have any. Protocols like diffie hellman help since it allows for two parties to exchange a private key over a potentially compromised channel in a secure way.
6. .
7. The primary weaknesses are that we can defeat it with using things like rubber fingers, legal issues since biometric data is closely regulated, and once your biometrics get leaked then you can't just change your password.
8. Role based access control is the idea that we have static roles that can give permissions (many to many relationships) based on what roles a user has. For mandatory access control, rather than a direct access control, the system keeps a map of who is allowed to do what with which resources
9. An initialization vector is the initial value we use for a cryptographic function, sometimes this IV needs to be kept secret like the case for certain chaining cryptographic functions
10. .
11. .
12. A digital signature is a way of undeniably proving that a certain person sent a certain file, and we do this by calculating the hash of the file we sent mixed with our private key in a very similar way to most other hashes.
13. I actually don't know
14. Mutual authentication is the idea that we need to prove to the system that we are who we claim to be, and we also need the system to prove that it is legitimate to the user to avoid certain scams 
15. Physical security is considered very important because if an attacker has physical access to our computers their attack vectors become much larger, and of course they could just steal drives or smash computers.
