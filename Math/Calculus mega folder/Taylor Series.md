these are based on [[Taylor Swift Polynomials]] and what we say is that if f is infinitely differentiable at x=c, then the Taylor series is
$$\sum^\infty_{n=0}\frac{f^n(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n$$

if we have a function that can be represented by a power series centered at C, then that power series will end up being the Taylor series.
