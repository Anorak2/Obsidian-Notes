A non-singular matrix, or an [[Invertible Matrices|invertible matrix]], is a matrix whose determinant is not equal to 0, and a property of a non-singular matrix is that they are always invertible. All of the below properties are equivalent:
- A is non-singular
- the system $Aa = b$ has a unique solution for all column matrices b
- the system $Aa = 0$ has only the trivial solution
- A is row equivalent to $I_n$
- A can be written as a product of elementary matrices
- A is [[Invertible Matrices|invertible]]
- |A| != 0

singular matrix is identical to the following:
- A is a non-[[Invertible Matrices|invertible]] matrix
- |A| = 0
- [[Rank]](A) < n
- the columns of A are linearly dependent
- the rows of A are linearly dependent
- A cannot be reduced to the identity matrix
