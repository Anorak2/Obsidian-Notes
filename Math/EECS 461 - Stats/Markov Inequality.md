The Markov inequality is like the [[Chebychev Inequality]] and the [[Chernoff Boundary]] in that it deals with the bounds on RV tail probabilities. These are probabilities for values far from the mean.
 
For a random variable X, such that $P[X < 0] = 0$, and a constant c
$$P[X \geq c^2]\leq \frac{E[x]}{c^2}$$
As C gets larger, G is further out on the PDFs tail and the probability will get even smaller. This is also only valid for non negative RVs, and it uses only the mean of G.
