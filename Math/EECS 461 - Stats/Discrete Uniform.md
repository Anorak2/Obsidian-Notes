The case of equally likely outcomes, like the odds of a binary sequence that has n 1's. In this case every sequence of events has a probability of $1/v$, where there are $P_n$ sequences and $v= {n \choose m}$ 

**PMF**
$$\frac{1}{v}$$ for $f = f_1, f_2, ... fv$ , otherwise 0 

**EXPECTED VALUE** 
$E[Y] = \mu_y = \frac{k+l}{2}$
