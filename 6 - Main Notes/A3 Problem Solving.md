![[Pasted image 20251225021435.png]]
The A3 method is a simple and strict technique for solving problems in a defined way, following the stages on a piece of A3 paper. This also forces the solver to simplify enough that each section can properly fit on the page, improving clarity and ensuring the solver understands the problem deeply.

**Plan**
- Clarify Problem: Understand the context, situation, and why this problem matters
- Define Problem: Create a clear, specific problem statement
- Set Goal: Establish measurable targets and success criteria
- Root Cause Analysis: Identify the true underlying causes using tools like 5 Whys or Fish-bone

**Do-Check- Act**
- Countermeasures: Develop and select solutions that address root causes
- Check Results: Implement, measure, and verify effectiveness of countermeasures
- Follow up and standardize: Document and standardize successful solutions
- Reflect & Yokoten: Capture learnings and share knowledge across the organization
