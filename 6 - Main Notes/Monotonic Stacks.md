# Monotonic Stacks
A monotonic stack is a specific type of stack that is used for problem solving and it maintains it's elements in either an increasing or decreasing order. It's often used for solving problems like the next greatest element.

**What is it**
Monotonic stacks exactly like normal stacks but with the added constraint that elements inside are arranged in an increasing (>=) or decreasing (<=) order based on their arrival time.
