# MAC Addresses
A MAC address is used to  "locally"  to get a frame from one interface to another physically connected interface (same subnet in the IP sense).  Often the 48 bit MAC address is burned directly into the network interface card but sometimes it is software settable. Something worth noting is that MAC's can move from one interface to another, while IP addresses are not portable

**Setting:** MAC addresses are allocated by IEEE and a manufacturer buys a portion of the MAC addresses.
