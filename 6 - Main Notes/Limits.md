## Definition
> A limit is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the argument approaches some value. Limits are the fundamental building blocks of calculus and are used to define Derivatives, Integrals, and More

**One Sided Limits**
$\lim f(x) = L$
x -> $c^-$
the left limit of f is L if the y values converge to L as x approaches c through values less than C

$\lim f(x) = L$
x -> $c^+$
the right limit of f is L if the y values converge to L as x approaches c through values less than C

**Two Sided Limits**
The two sided limit of f is L only if both one sided limits equal L. ie the limit does not exist if the left and right don't equal each other.

#### When limits don't exist
- infinities: We do sometimes write that a limit equals infinity equals infinity but this means it doesn't exist as we are looking for a finite number with limits
- Jumps: If jumps exist then the function implies two different values which doesn't make sense
- Oscillation: If a function is oscillating then it sometimes can't be proven that the output ever "settles" and gives us a single answer
##  Basic Limit Laws

| Identity              | $\lim\limits_{x \to c} x = c$                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Constant              | $\lim\limits_{x \to c}  1 =1$                                                                          |
| Sum Law               | $\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x) + g(x)) = \lim\limits_{x \to c}(f(x)) + \lim\limits_{x \to c}(g(x))$      |
| Constant Multiple Law | $\lim\limits_{x \to c}(kf(x)) = k( \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x))$<br>                                    |
| Product Law           | $\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x) \cdot g(x)) = \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)\cdot \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)$ |
| Power Law             | $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)^n = (\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x))^n$                                         |
**Quotient Law:**
$$\lim\limits_{x \to c}(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}) = \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$$

#### Assumptions Matter
every basic limit law assumes that the the limits exist. if either limit fails to exist, the limit laws cannot be applied

## Limits as X goes to Infinity
When we are talking about what a graph does as $x \to \infty$ is we are talking about [[Limits|limits]]. And a limit in this situation will do a couple of things, it will converge to a constant L, or it will not converge and go to positive or negative infinity. In the first case think of Asymptotes. If we have an asymptote f(x) who's limit is equal to 5, what that means is we can make f(x) as close to 5 as we like by just making x larger.
