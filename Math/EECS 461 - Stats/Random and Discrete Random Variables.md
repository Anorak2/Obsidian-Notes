A random Variable **RV** maps outcomes of a sample space to numbers, though an RV is neither random nor a variable.

RV: Y (upper case)
Range of the RV: $S_Y$ : All possible values of Y
Particular value of the RV: y(lower case)

A RV consists of an experiment with a probability measure P[\*]
defined on a sample space $S^I$  and a mapping that assigns a real number to each outcome in S. the set of such numbers is called the range of the RV represented by S (since it corresponds to the sample space of an experiment)

i) number of times a student attempts to compile a program until it compiles successfully. The observation is the value of the RV. 

ii) Length of the time it takes to run a particular program on a particular computing platform. The observation can be the value of the RV. 

iii) observe the semester grades for an EECS 461 class. Calculate the average grade of the class using: 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for D. The RV maps the observation using the formula.

RV Y is a Discrete RV if the range of Y is a countable set $S_1=[y_1, y_2, ...]$ 

RV Y is a Continuous RV if S, is an interval of the real line or a union of such

Example 99) is a CRV

Previous example iii) is strictly speaking a DRV, but might be modeled as a CRV, especially if the number of students is large. Then the range would be [0,4]
