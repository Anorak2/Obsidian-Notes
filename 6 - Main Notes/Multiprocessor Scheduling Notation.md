# Multiprocessor Scheduling Notation


**Rigid Jobs**
- These are jobs that require a set number of processors and that number is static throughout its runtime
- This is probably the most common since it is much easier to write
**Moldable**
- The number of processors for the job can be set dynamically at the start, whether by user or system, but is static throughout the runtime
**Malleable**
- The number of processors can change dynamically at runtime
- This is the most flexible but it is very difficult to implement, if somebody implemented then you know it is sophisticated software
