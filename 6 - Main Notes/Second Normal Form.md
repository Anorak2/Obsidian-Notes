# Second Normal Form

First to be in 2NF, a schema must be in the [[First Normal Form]] as well as every non-prime attribute must be dependent on the entire primary key

**This means no partial dependencies**: no attribute that isn't part of a candidate key (non-prime), should be [[Functional Dependencies|Functionally Dependent]] on only part of the primary key

**Full functional Dependency on the entire key** all non prime attributes must depend on the entire key
