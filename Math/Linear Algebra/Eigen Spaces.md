Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue, and suppose that A is a square matrix of order n, and that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A. 

Then the eigen space $E(\lambda)$ is defined to be the set of all solutions to 
$$E(\lambda) = 

\left\{

\begin{array}{lr}

x \in R^n : (\lambda I - A)x = 0\\

 x \in C^n : (\lambda I - A)x = 0

\end{array}

\right\} 
$$
if $\lambda$ is real then $E(\lambda)$ is a subspace of $R^n$ and if $\lambda$ is complex $E(\lambda)$ is a subspace of the complex numbers
