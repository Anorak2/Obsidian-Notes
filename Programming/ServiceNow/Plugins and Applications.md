**Plugins**
Plugins are plug and play applications created by ServiceNow that can be free or paid, but they easily add functionality outside of the default platform. Plugins can really range from tiny to huge on a case by case basis.

**Applications**
These are shipped through the application store and can be created by either ServiceNow or by partners and they usually have a custom scope. Applications tend to be large and support many features.
