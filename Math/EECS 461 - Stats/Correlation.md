Not to be confused with[[Correlation Coefficient (fixing Cov)| The correlation coefficient]]. 

**DEFINITION**
The correlation of G and H is:
$E[GH] = r_{G,H}$ 

It is related to [[Covariance]], in fact another  covariance definition is 
$Cov[G,H] = \sigma_{GH} = r_{GH} - \mu_G \space \mu_H$ 

**SPECIAL CASES**
G and H are orthogonal iff $E[GH] = r_{G,H} = 0$ 
Correlation = 0 weirdly does not mean uncorrelated
If G and H are orthogonal then $E[(G+H)^2] = E[G^2]+E[H^2]$ 

G and H are uncorrelated iff $Cov[G,H] = 0 = \rho_{GH}$, or in words both the [[Covariance]] and correlation are 0
