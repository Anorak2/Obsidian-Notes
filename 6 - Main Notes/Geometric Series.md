# Geometric Series
A Geometric sequence is a sequence where $a_n = ar^n$ where a and r are nonzero constants. R is called the common ratio since it applies to every item in the sequence.

**divergence criteria** 
let a /= 0. if |r| < 1 than the infinite sum = $\frac{a}{1-r}$, and if |r| > 1 then the [[Series]] diverges


**Sum of a Geometric series**


$$S_n = \frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}$$

or if  |r| < 1

$$ S_n = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
