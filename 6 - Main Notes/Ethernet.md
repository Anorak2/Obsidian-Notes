# Ethernet
Ethernet is the dominant wired LAN technology, it's simple, cheap, and fast. It used to be bus based where all nodes can collide with eachother but now the switched version is much more popular. There is an active link-layer 2 switch each computer connects to and each "spoke" runs a separate ethernet protocol such that the nodes don't collide with eachother.
