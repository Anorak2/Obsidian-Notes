# Tree

Trees are a very simple idea, but with many complicated ideas that extend them. Fundamentally though, a tree is just a root node that connects to other nodes. There can be as many children (nodes below a node) that connect to a parent as we want, but usually we choose 2 nodes since it is very useful for a lot of algorithms like [[Binary Search Trees]] and really we don't gain much from arbitrarily increasing the amount of children.
