**Mathematical definition**: Probability is a mapping of events to numbers in [0, 1]

So, if A is an event then 0<= P[A] <= 1, according to axioms

Generally, P[A] measures the likelihood of the event A

P[a]= 0 means A cannot occur
P[a]= 1 means A must occur

**Probability Axioms**
Axiom 1: For every event E, $P[E] \geq 0$ 
Axiom 2: P[S] = 1
Axiom 3: For all countably infinite collections $E_1, E_e$ of Mutually exclusive events, P ($E_1 \cup E_2 \cup ...$) = P($E_1$) + P($E_2$) + $...$
