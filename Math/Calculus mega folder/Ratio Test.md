when we're testing a [[Sequences|sequence]] with the ratio test we use:
$$p =\lim_{n \to \infty}\space |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| =\lim_{n \to \infty}\space a_{n+1} * a_n^{-1}$$
we then group like terms and try to cancel out as much as we can.

if p < 1, then $\sum a_n$ converges absolutely
if p > 1 then $\sum a_n$ diverges
if p = 1 then the test is inconclusive
