# Flow Designer

The flow designer is a tool that allows for easy automation using a gui, instead of coding since who would want to do that. It seems to be designed for simpler things but can account for branching logic.

Triggers are what starts the flow and these can be based around records inside of the table, they can be based around a certain date/time, or they can be based around applications such as when a certain state is met.
