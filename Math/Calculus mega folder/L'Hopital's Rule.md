if you remember the 7 [[Limit indeterminate forms]], there are several which are battles between which one is growing faster.

L'Hopital's rule is that if you have $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$ then you can take the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of the top and the bottom as many times as needed to get the limit.

# $\infty - \infty$
to evaluate this form we use algebra to rewrite the expression as a quotient, often in 0/0 or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Often this means finding a common denominator.

# $0*\infty$
this can easily be converted to 0/0 or $\infty/\infty$ form. There are actually two ways to do this, because $1/\infty$ is 0 we can make one of the two functions  $\frac{g(x)}{1/f(x)}$ to make it zero over zero, we can also do the inverse to make it infinity over infinity.

# $1^\infty$, $0^0$, $\infty^0$
the key thing here is to turn the limit into e^ln(a), then to exp(ln()), and then to exp(lim ln(a)).  Basically everything turns into $e^{x*\infty}$. by doing this we can just turn it into another form where we can easily apply L'Hopital's.
