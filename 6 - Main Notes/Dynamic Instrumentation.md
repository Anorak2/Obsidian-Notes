# Dynamic Instrumentation
Dynamic Instrumentation is done during runtime and it gets the benefit of having a lot of unpredictable information at runtime available to it such as user input or server input. Dynamic instrumentation is often seen in the form of dynamic debuggers like [[Gnu Debugger (GDB)]] or when the source code isn't available to us.
