# Ports
Sockets are the solution to demultiplexing data sent to the same host but intended for different applications. There are 32 bits allocated that correspond to ports numbered from 0-1023, called the well known ports with specific and common uses, and their are other ports in the range of 1024 to 65535.

The point is to have a mechanism for addressing a particular process on a computer so that we can isolate traffic.
