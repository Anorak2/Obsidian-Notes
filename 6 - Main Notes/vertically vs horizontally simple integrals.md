# vertically vs horizontally simple integrals
> This topic only exists when we are talking about iterated integrals, and specifically double integrals 

**Vertically Simple**
If we have a vertically simple region, which means we for the bounds of the integral every one has a one to one match between the top and bottom (no loops or fancy shit). 
$$\int\int_Df(x,y)\space dA = \int_a^b \left(\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y)\space dy \right) dx$$ **Horizontally Simple**
$$\int\int_Df(x,y)\space dA = \int_a^b \left(\int_{h_1(x)}^{h_2(x)} f(x,y)\space dx \right) dy$$
## Examples

Figure 1. For this example it would be easier to represent it vertically since we would only need to take one integral instead of several

Figure 2. These functions would likely be easier to classify as horizontally simple since we can represent it as one integral x[-1.0, 1.0] , instead of one in two slices such as [-1, 0] and [0, 1]
