# Software Measurement Methodology 
**Basic Process:**
1. Formulation: The derivation of software measures and metrics appropriate for the representation of the software that is being considered.
2. Collection: The mechanism used to accumulate data required to derive the formulated metrics.
3. Analysis: The computation of metrics and the application of mathematical tools.
4. Interpretation: The evaluation of metrics results in insight into the quality of the representation.
5. Feedback: Recommendation derived from the interpretation of product metrics transmitted to the software team.
Note that this is basically identical to the scientific method and to the Data Mining process

**Why do we need it?**
- To ensure quality, anticipate future qualities, or to enhance the quality
- Regulate the state of the project concerning budget and schedule.
- Enable data-driven decision-making in project planning and control.
- Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement to drive process improvement activities.
- Ensure that industry standards and regulations are followed.
- Give software products and processes a quantitative basis for evaluation.
- Enable the ongoing improvement of software development practices.
