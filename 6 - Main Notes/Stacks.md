# Stacks

A stack is a data structure that lets us do several different operations: push (add to stack), pop (remove from stack), peek (see top element), and size (amount of elements). That is really all we need for a basic implementation of a stack. Stacks can actually be surprisingly useful, an example would be a [[Pushdown Automata]]
