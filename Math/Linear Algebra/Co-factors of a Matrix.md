The co-factors of a matrix are set up in a checkerboard pattern, for example the co-factors of a 3x3 matrix is equal to multiplying each position by this the sign in it's position
$$\begin{bmatrix}
+ & - & + \\
- & + & - \\
+ & - & + \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
you can tell if a position is positive by using $(-1^{m+n})a_{m,n}$
