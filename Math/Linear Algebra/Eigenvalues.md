Eigenvalues are used because they describe the transformation of a matrix, since eigenvalues aren't changed by the linear transformations just scaled. another way to think about it is that eigenvalues are the scaling factor.

**Characteristic Equation**
An eigenvalue $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue if and only if
$$|\lambda I - A| = 0$$
if the lambda is complex then as a rule of thumb there is some kind of rotation that is occurring, but we mainly focus on the reals here. If it is real then that means $Av = \lambda v$
