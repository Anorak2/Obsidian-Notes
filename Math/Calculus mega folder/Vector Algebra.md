**Triangle law**
if we have two [[Vector Definition|vectors]] u and v, and we set v up so that it starts where u ends, u+v is the vector from the start of u to the end of v.

**Scalar multiplication**
we can multiply a [[Vector Definition|vector]] by any real number, and it's length gets multiplied by the vector. if we multiply a vector by .5, then the original vector's length will be divided by two. If we multiply by a negative number, then the direction of the vector will also flip by 180 degrees

$A\to B$:
we can just represent this as $\lt x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1 \gt$
