we can't always describe functions with y = f(x), since those are kinda bitch-made. So what we can do is express both variables in terms of a third variable called T. That new variable T is called a parameter, and when we give parametric equations for a term we say we have parameterized it. 

# Paramaterizing

### Lines:
the line through the point (a,b) with a slope of s/r is parameterized by:
$$ x = a + rt$$ $$y = b+st$$
### Segments:
The line through P=(a,b) and Q = (c,d) is parameterized on the interval [0, 1] by the equations 

$$x = a + t(c-d)$$
$$y = b + t(d-b)$$
### Circles
The circle centered at C = (a, b) with radius r is parameterized by the equations
$$x = a + r\cos(t)$$
$$y = b + r\sin(t)$$
