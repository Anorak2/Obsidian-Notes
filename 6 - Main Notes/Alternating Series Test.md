# Alternating Series Test


# References


Assume that $b_n$ is a positive [[Series]] that is decreasing and converges to zero, if we can meet these three conditions then the following alternating series converges

$$\sum^\infty_{n=1}\space(-1)^{n-1}b_n = b_1 - b_2 + b_3 - b_4 ...$$

this test can only show convergence though, not divergence

### Error
if $a_n$ converges by the [[Alternating Series Test]], then the error is $|S-S_n| < b_n +1$
