# Adversary to Quicksort

The way to defeat quicksort is by creating an input such that when we do our quicksort on the array we end up with bad pivots, resulting in an unbalanced call tree and a quadratic time complexity.

Gas values = Items whose relationship is unknown to eachother
- Make all values gas values
- When we compare two gas items we freeze one into a definite solid value, which is greater than any already solid value
Solid values will always compare low to gas values, and when two solid values are compared it depends on the values.
