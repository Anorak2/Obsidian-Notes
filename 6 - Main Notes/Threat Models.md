# Threat Models
> threat models are absolutely crucial to evaluating the security of literally anything. If we assume our adversaries (anyone attempting to cause a security incident) are omnipotent then our system is trivially insecure, and if we assume only babies are trying to cause security incidents then all software should~ be safe.

A **Threat Model** is composed of a set of adversary goals and a set of adversary capabilities.
