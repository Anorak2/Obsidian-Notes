# Improper Integrals, Comparing Integrals
We deal with these by using everyone's favorite, [[Limits|Limits]]

## Infinite

to do this quickly it's just integrating and then quickly plugging in the limit where x = infinity and then finding the form. If it's infinite then the limit diverges, otherwise the limit converges to a value.
## Unbounded

This works out to be similar to the previous one in practice.

## Comparing Integrals

if the smaller integral diverges, then by definition the larger integral will also diverge, but if you know the smaller integral converges, then you know nothing.

Likewise, if the larger integral converges, then you know that the smaller has to also converge. and the same goes where if the larger integral diverges you know nothing about the other integral.
