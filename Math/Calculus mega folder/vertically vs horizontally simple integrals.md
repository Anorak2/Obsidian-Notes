**Vertically Simple**
If we have a vertically simple region, which means we for the bounds of the integral every one has a one to one match between the top and bottom (no loops or fancy shit). 
$$\int\int_Df(x,y)\space dA = \int_a^b \left(\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y)\space dy \right) dx$$ **Horizontally Simple**
$$\int\int_Df(x,y)\space dA = \int_a^b \left(\int_{h_1(x)}^{h_2(x)} f(x,y)\space dx \right) dy$$
