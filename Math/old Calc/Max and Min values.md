### Extrema
**Extremum**: shorthand word the means either maximum or minimum 

An endpoint of the domain f **cannot** be a local or absolute extrema because it cannot be contained in any open interval

# Absolute Extrema
A function has an absolution maximum at c if f(c) is greater than f(x) for **all** values of x, the inverse is true for the absolute minimum. 

Unless it is an endpoint each absolute extremum is also a local extremum. A function can also only have **at most one** absolute maximum value but any number of absolute maximum **points**.

### Extreme Value Theorem
if f is continuous on a closed interval [a,b] , then f attains a maximum value f(c) and an absolute minimum value f(d) at some numbers c and d in [a.,b]. 

basically for any finite [a,b] there must be an absolute max and min

### Closed interval Method
to find the absolute extreme values of a continuous function f on a closed interval [a,b]

1. check the **critical numbers** in (a,b)
2.  check the endpoints
3. pick out the biggest one and pick out the smallest one to get absolute extrema
# Local Extrema
A local maximum is a maximum in a certain part or "near" a certain part

A local minimum is a point that is less then every other point "near" that point

# Critical Number
A number c in the domain of f is called a critical number if either f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist. 

**Fermat's Theorem**
if f has a local extremum at x=c then f'(c) exists, then f'(c)=0. That is, if f has a local max or min at c, then c is a critical number of f.

or more basically, not every critical point must be a local max or min
