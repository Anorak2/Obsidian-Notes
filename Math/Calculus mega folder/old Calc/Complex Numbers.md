when you take the square root of a negative number

any polynomial equation in real coefficients has a (all) solution in complex numbers

(Abel) - if you have a general polynomial with a degree >5 with real coefficients then there is no formula for finding its roots


addition:
$$(a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)(i)$$
subtraction:
$$(a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)(i)$$
multiplication:
$$(a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)i$$
division:
$$\frac{(a_1a_2 + b_1b_2)}{(a_2^2 + b_2^2)} + \frac{(a_2b_1 + a_1b_2)}{(a_2^2 + b_2^2)}$$

a1          b1
a2          b2
$(a_1a_2 - b_1b_2)$ - down then subtract
$(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)(i)$ - Across then plus


#### Absolute Value
to find the absolute value of z = a + bi
you just use $z = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$
