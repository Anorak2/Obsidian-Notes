The CIA triad is the balance between the integrity of the program, the availability of the program to users, and the confidentiality of information. In practice usually two out of three of these considerations have to be prioritized over the third as having all three is exceptionally difficult.

- Confidentiality – The control of access to data
- Integrity – The consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle
- Availability – The degree of consistent accessibility of data
