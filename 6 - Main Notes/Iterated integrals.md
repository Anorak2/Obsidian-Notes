# Iterated integrals
We can calculate the volume of the area under a surface by Using Fubini's theorem which states we can break up an integral into double or triple [[Integrals|integrals]] which we call iterated integrals

$$\int\int\int_Rf(x,y) \space dA = \int^a_b \int_c^d \int_e^f f(x,y)\space dx \space\space dy \space\space dz$$

**split double integrals**
a double integral is called split if it has the form $f(x)g(y)$ and we can find the solution by doing:
$$\int\int_Rf(x)g(y) \space dA = \left(\int_a^bf(x)dx \right)\left(\int_c^dg(y)dy \right)$$

for example, $x^2y$ is a split integral but $x+y$ isn't

**Changing Order**
In order to change the order of integration you need to ideally sketch the geometry and then find the limits of integration geometrically or algebraically
