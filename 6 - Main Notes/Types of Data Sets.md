# Types of Data Sets
## Record

**Data Matrix**
> IF data objects have the same fixed set of numeric attributes then the data objects can be thought of as points in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension is an attribute. This data can be represented by an m by n rows with one row per object and one col per attribute. Think tables or excel as an example.

**Document Data**
> In this form each document becomes a "term" vector, the value of each component is the number of times the corresponding term occurs in the document. Here the rows still represent documents, but for object will have a number representing how many times each word, such as "Here" may appear and with a given value such as "2" (which is accurate to this document). 

**Transaction Data**
> This is a special type of record data where each record (transaction) involves a set of items. In a grocery store this would be what each customer purchased when they checked out.

**Market Basked Data**
> A large set of items, e.g., things sold in a supermarket.
> A large set of baskets, each of which is a small subset of the items, e.g. the things one customer buys on one day
## Graph Data
Some examples of graph data would be a generic graph, social network, or web pages and graphs store the relations/connections between nodes or items.

## Ordered Data
> Ordered Data is a sequential series of transaction. Ex: Genomic Sequence Data 
> `GGTTACG`  is destroyed if the order is changed
