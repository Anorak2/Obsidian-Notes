# Higher Derivatives
> A higher derivative is a derivative with form $f^{(n)}$ which denotes taking the derivative of the function, and then taking the derivative of that result n times. Doing this can be super useful, for example in increasing levels of derivation we go from velocity (0) -> acceleration (1) -> jerk (2)

#### Direction of change
if f'(x) > 0  on an interval then f is increasing on that interval

if f'(x) < 0  on an interval then f is decreasing on that interval

#### Concavity
f(x) is concave **up** on(a,b) if the graph of f is above the the tangent line at every point in (a,b)

f(x) is concave **down** on(a,b) if the graph of f is below the the tangent line at every point in (a,b)

#### Concave and second derivative
f''(x) is concave **up** on(a,b) then f is concave up on (a,b)

f''(x) is concave **down** on(a,b) then f is concave down on (a,b)
