# Unstructured Data

This is kind of the opposite of [[Structured Data]], which to be honest isn't that useful. Unstructured data is a non pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Examples include free text, flat binary files containing text, and video or audio. It is important to note that there still is some structure here like a file format or choice of language. 

**Challenges**
It can be hard to do things like understand natural languages, and many people argue that for true natural language understanding we require a general artificial intelligence. The lack of structure also makes it take a lot of energy to compile and organize unstructured data.
