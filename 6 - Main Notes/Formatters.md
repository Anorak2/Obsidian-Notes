# Formatters

Formatters are elements that are custom ways to display information that is not a field in record. A good example is how the activity stream can display the status/changes over time.

There are some base Formatters, like the following
- Activity
- Process
- Parent Breadcrumbs
- Approval Summarizer
- CI relations
