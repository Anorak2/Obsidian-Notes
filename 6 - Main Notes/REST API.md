# REST API
REST, or Representational State Transfer is a set of constraints used for creating web services that are typically based around HTTP methods or using XML/JSON to send data.

The rest API follows six constraints, and if you do all of them then it is said to be restful.
1. Client-server architecture
	This is similar to the [[Three Layer Architecture]] but the principle is the same that we should separate the user from concerns like managing data etc
2. Statelessness
	NO session info should be retained by the server, every packet should be able to be understood in isolation.
3. Cache-ability
		
4. Layered System
5. Uniform Interface
6. (Optional) Code on demand
