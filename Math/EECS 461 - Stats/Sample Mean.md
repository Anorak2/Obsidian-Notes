The sample mean is just another way of saying the expected value that we observed from a [[Sums of Random Variables]]. The sample mean is also just another random value itself since each time we run an experiment we get back a sample, hence the name.  

The sample mean for iid random variables $X_1,...,X_n$ with a PDF $F_X(x)$, the sample mean is:
$$M_n(X)=(X_1+...+X_n)/n$$ 
variance: $$\frac{Var[X]}{n}$$

Another interesting property of taking samples is that due to the law of large number $M_n(G)$ approaches $E[G] = \mu_G$ as $n \to \infty$
