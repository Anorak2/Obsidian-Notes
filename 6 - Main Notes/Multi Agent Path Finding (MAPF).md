# Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF)
![[Pasted image 20250413134850.png]]
Multi agent path finding is the problem where we need to route multiple different agents to multiple different points without having any collisions, where we often try to minimize the average time to reach the destination. This problem is bounded because of course we could just wait for an agent to reach their destination before starting the next agent, but of course this approach isn't practical for almost every case. In fact, it has been shown that this problem is NP-Hard to solve optimally meaning that having some form of non-optimal solution could help improve the runtime meaningfully.
