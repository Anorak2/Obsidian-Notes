# Problem Solving Strategies
## Representation and Search
![[Pasted image 20251225014209.png]]
This is a very intuitive version of a process, the basic idea is that the problem should be understood through a representation. If there is prior knowledge we can skip straight on the schema path, otherwise we must search for a solution. If the solution works then we are done, if it fails then we must update our representation to include the new data we have gained.

This model is so obvious I almost didn't write it down, but pitfalls can happen naturally if for example I failed to represent the problem properly and instead hastily jumped ahead to try to implement a solution.

As an example of schema, if I was given an algebra problem where I must solve to X I would intuitively try to reduce instances of X and isolate X on one side of the equation.

## Specific Strategies
**Abstraction:**
Solve the problem in a simplified version before scaling that solution to the real problem

**Analogy:**
Compare the problem to another known problem

**Brainstorming**
Suggest a large number of ideas or solutions until an optimal one is found

**Bypass**
Transform the problem itself into a problem that is easier to solve

**Divide and Conquer**
Break a large problem down into component problems

**Lateral Thinking**
Approach the problem from an uncommon angle

**Means-end Analysis**
choose an action at each step that pushes you closer towards the goal

**Morphological**
Examine the inputs and outputs of the system as a whole

**Reduction**
Transform the problem into one where solutions exist

**Root Cause**
Identify why a problem exists in the first place
