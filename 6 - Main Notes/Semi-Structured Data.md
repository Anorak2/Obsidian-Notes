# Semi-Structured

Many different applications require storing complex data where the schema often changes or even on a case by case basis. The idea here is that the [[Relational Databases]] requirement for atomic data types is a little overkill. In particular, data exchange is a really great use case for semi-structured and file types like JSON and XML were designed for that.
