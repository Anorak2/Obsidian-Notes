# Direct Comparison Test
Assume there exists M > 0 such that $0 \lt= a_n \lt= b_n$ for all n > M

then if the function M is "bigger" than the original, and it converges, then the original also converges. If the function M is smaller than the original, and it diverges, then the original also diverges. 

if it doesn't fit either of these two then we can't say anything and we have to use a different test, often the [[Limit Comparison test]].
