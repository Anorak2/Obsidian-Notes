A vector is a geometric object that has both a length (magnitude) and direction, and vectors can be represented as how to "get" from one point to another point



We can calculate the angle between two vectors using:
$$\cos \theta = \frac{v_1u_1 + v_2u_2}{||u|| \space||v||}$$


The length of a vector, or magnitude, is described by:
 $$||v|| = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+...+v_n^2}$$
