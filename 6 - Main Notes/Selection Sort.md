# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a [[Formal Sorting Definition|sorting algorithm]] that works by looping through each element and adding it from an unsorted portion of the array to a sorted portion of the array.

**Sort Properties**
This algorithm is $\Theta(n^2)$ if we use an array or a similar structure, this algorithm is inefficient compared to other sorting algorithms

**Algorithm**
- Find the smallest item in the unsorted section of the array
- Move it to the end of the sorted portion of the array
- Selection sort the rest of the items
