Communication patterns are the different ways that we can connect a series of nodes together, this could be for large scale computing or for router configurations or even just roads between houses. Some important terms; **Point to Point** is when we route a message from one source node to one destination node, and **Collective Communication** is when sending/receiving messages involve a group of nodes using a well known pattern.
