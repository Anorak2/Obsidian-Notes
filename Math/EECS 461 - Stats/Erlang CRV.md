Erlang CRV is often used to model the time until the nth arrival of a Poisson arrival process

**PDF**
Y is an Erlang($n, \lambda$) CRV if its PDF is
$$p[k,p] =
\frac{\lambda^ny^{n-1}e^{-\lambda y}}{(n-1)!}
$$
where $y \geq 0$, and 0 otherwise. Here $\lambda > 0$ and n is a positive integer

**MEAN (EXPECTED VALUE)**
$E[Y] = \mu_y = n/\lambda$ 

**VAR**
$Var[Y] = n/\lambda^2$
