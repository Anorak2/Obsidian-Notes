# Exhaustive Proof
Sometimes we can just do a proof by checking every single case individually, say if we had a conjecture that f(x) is greater than zero for positive integers less than 5. In this case all we have to do is check 1, 2, 3, and 4. if it holds for all of these values then the proof is completed. In practice exhaustive proofs become either very difficult or impossible for most problems, for example if we are proving something that applies to all real numbers we cannot do this
