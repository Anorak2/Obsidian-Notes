# database views
A view is basically a SQL query that can act as a virtual table. It can fetch data from multiple different tables in complicated ways and allows for developers to treat that process as a singular entity. It's important to remember that views exist on top of the actual data in the database, and that we recalculate the query each time that we need to. Sometimes depending on how they are implemented views allow for editing data as well.

A good example of when to use a view would be a user checking to see which books are available to be checked out.
