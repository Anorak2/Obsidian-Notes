# Object Relational Databases

Object relational data models provide a richer type system with complex data types and object orientation. This makes sense because applications are often written in oop languages like [[Java]] and it can be a little odd when the type system doesn't match the [[Structured Data|relational system]] 

**Approaches**
- Building an object-relational database adding different object oriented features to a relational database
- Automatically convert data between the programming language model and relational model
- Build an object oriented database that natively supports object oriented data
