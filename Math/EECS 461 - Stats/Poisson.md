Describes cases where "things" happen randomly in time but with a known average number of occurrences over a unit of time

**PMF**
$$P_F(g)=\frac{\alpha^g\space e^{-\alpha}}{g!}$$
where we have a known arrival rate of $\lambda$ arrivals per unit of time and $T$ time units, with $\alpha$ = $\lambda * T$. This returns the odds of a certain (g) amount of arrivals 

**EXPECTED VALUE**
$E[y] = \mu_y = \alpha$
