A set is fundamental a group of unordered objects, where each thing in the set is called an element of the set. That's really it as far as math is concerned.

There are also a number of common sets such as $\varnothing$, $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$. 
In order these represent: The empty set, the set of natural numbers, the set of integers, the set of rational numbers, the set of real numbers, and lastly the set of complex numbers
