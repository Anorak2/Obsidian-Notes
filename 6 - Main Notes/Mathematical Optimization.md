# Mathematical Optimization
$$\nabla f = (f_x,f_y) = \lambda *\nabla g(x,y) $$

**critical points**
if the [[Gradient Vector]] f is equal to the 0 vector at a point then that point is a critical point, though not all critical points are extrema

**second derivative test**
$$D(a,b) = \begin{bmatrix}
f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
f_{yx} & f_{yy} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
and then you find the [[Determinant of 2x2 Matrix|determinant]] of that to get the value of D

1. D > 0, $f_{xx}$ > 0 then a,b is a local minimum
2. D > 0 and $f_{xx} < 0$ then a,b is a local max
3. D < 0 then a,b is a saddle point
4. D = 0 the test is inconclusive
