# Attribute Types
- Nominal values provide only enough information to distinguish one object from another
- Ordinal attributes provide data on how the node relates to other nodes, if a chip is the 3rd best then that tells us data not only on that chip.
- Interval attributes the differences between values are meaningful; Ex temperature in Fahrenheit
- Ratio variables both differences and ratio are meaningful; Ex: temperature in kelvin, length, time, counts

The type of attribute depends on if it posses:
- Distinctness = $\not =$ 
- Order < >
- Addition + -
- Multiplication * /

Nominal: distinctness
Ordinal: Distinctness and order
Interval: Distinctness, order, and addition
Ratio: All four
