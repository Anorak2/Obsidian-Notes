# Cylindrical Coordinates
Cylindrical coordinates are very similar to [[Polar Coordinates]] except that cylindrical coordinates are in $R^3$ 

Cylindrical coordinates are defined by 
$(r, \theta, z)$

where r and $\theta$ are the [[Polar Coordinates]] for a slice of the function, and z is the exact same as Cartesian coordinates where it determines the elevation. In cylindrical coordinates we usually assume r >= 0

#### Converting 
converting from Cartesian to cylindrical
$x = rcos(\theta)$             $y=rsin(\theta)$             $z=z$

converting from cylindrical to Cartesian
$r^2 = x^2+y^2$
$tan(\theta)=y/x$
$z=z$
