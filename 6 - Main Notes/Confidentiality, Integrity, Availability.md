# Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
The main thing here is that to have security we need to balance between confidentiality, which is controlling the access to the data/machines. Integrity, which is harder to define but includes currency, accuracy, precision, and resilience of the data. Lastly there is availability, which is harder to mesh with the other two but it is defined by the user being able to use whatever it is.

A system is available if does:
- Timely responses to requests
- Fair resource allocation
- fault tolerance
- ease of use
- provides concurrency controlled

Other parts of security include:
- Anonymity
- Atomicity
- Authentication
- Fairness
- Non-repudiation
