The identity matrix is a square matrix defined by $I_n$ where n is the size, and $I_n$ has the property that any matrix [[Matrix Multiplication|multiplied]] by $I_n$ is itself
$$AI_n = I_nA = A$$
The identity matrix looks like a diagonal row of one's with every other value set to 0, for example $I_3$ is equal to
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
