we have a number of functions that are a pain in the ass to work with, like $e^{x^2}$ which is terrible. it just can't be integrated easily using elementary functions. However, polynomials are comparatively easy to work with. WE can integrate them as much as we want, and we can easily compute their values.

$$ F(x) = f(c) + c'(c)(x-c)$$
the nth Taylor polynomial $T_n$ of f centered at c is defined as 
$$T_n(x) = f(c) + \frac{f'(c)}{1!}(x-c) \space... \space \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n$$
