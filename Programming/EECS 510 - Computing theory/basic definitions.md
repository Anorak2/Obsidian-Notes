**what is computation?**
execution of a self-contained procedure that processes input, without outside intervention, and (if everything goes well) eventually halts yielding output that corresponds to the input given.

These are frequently referred to as a black box

**What are procedures?**
a computing mechanism we call an abstract machine, theoretical model allowing for precise analysis of how a system functions

for our purposes, a procedure represents some underlying mathematical model

**What is an Algorithm**
For our purposes a computation that always [[The Halting Problem|halts]] 

**What is a language?**
a set of strings with some inherent structure used to express a computation
