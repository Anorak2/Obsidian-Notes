# Rice's Theorem
> All non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable

In the above definition a semantic property is one about the programs behavior, ex: does the program terminate for **all** inputs, unlike a syntactic property like does the program contain an if else statement.

## What it doesn't say

All **non-trivial** semantic properties of programs are undecidable
> This excludes properties that are true or false for every program

All non-trivial **semantic** properties of programs are undecidable
> This doesn't include behavior that can be discoverable by examining the text

All non-**trivial** semantic properties of programs are undecidable
> by non trivial what is meant is a property that is neither true for every program or false for every program
