# Transparency

**Data Organization transparency**
location transparency is when executions commands independent of location, and that object/table names are independent of location

**Replication transparency**
Copies of the same data at different locations

**Fragmentation transparency**
Users are unaware of fragmentation

**Design transparency**
freedom from knowing how the database is designed, the system just works

**Execution transparency**
Where a transaction executes
