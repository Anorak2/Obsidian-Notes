**One Sided Limits**
$\lim f(x) = L$
x -> $c^-$
the left limit of f is L if the y values converge to L as x approaches c through values less than C

$\lim f(x) = L$
x -> $c^+$
the right limit of f is L if the y values converge to L as x approaches c through values less than C

**Two Sided Limits**
The two sided limit of f is L only if both one sided limits equal L. ie the limit does not exist if the left and right don't equal each other.

#### When limits don't exist
**infinities:**
We do sometimes write that a limit equals infinity equals infinity but this means it doesn't exist as we are looking for a finite number with limits

**Jumps:**
Fairly self explanatory since it would converge to two different values

**Oscillation**
If it is just always bouncing then we can never know if it stops and approaches a number and we can't tell when it is oscillating and not approaching a number
