A matrix is said to be invertible if there is a matrix B such that $AB = BA = I_n$ 

To find the inverse of a $n*n$ matrix we add $I_n$ to A to form a matrix like $[A | I_m]$, and then we use elementary row operations to convert this new matrix to $[I_m|B]$, and $B=A^{-1}$.  If we end up with all zero's in the last row and non zeroes in the other rows then A doesn't have an inverse
