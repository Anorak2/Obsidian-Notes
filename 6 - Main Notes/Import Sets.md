# Import Sets

An import set is a tool to import data from various data sources, and map that data into ServiceNow tables. Data sources can include: JDBC, HTTP/FTP, Excel, CSV, and XML which then get put into an import set table (which is a staging area). We can then transform that data and insert it into a servicenow table.

Some best practices for importing include understanding what the data is and planning where it should go ahead of time, and to plan a time to verify your data before importing it. Lastly remove obsolete and inaccurate data (easier said than done...).
