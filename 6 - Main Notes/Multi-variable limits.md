# Multi-variable limits
To refer to a multi-variable limit we use the notation:
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L$$
As x approaches a, and as y approaches b, since we took the limit we can make the function f(x,y) as close to L as we want by making (x,y) closer to (a,b). This is similar to traditional one variable limits, and most of the same limit laws hold however we can no longer use direct substitution, this is because we have to examine every single possible path towards a point and make sure they all agree.

Since we have to make every curve agree, what we can do to work around it is use [[Polar Coordinates]], since we can convert to polar and then try to rearrange the function to factor out $\theta$ which means the angle of our approach doesn't matter
