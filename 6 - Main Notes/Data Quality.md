# Data Quality
> Poor data quality makes it very difficult to do many data mining tasks and can potentially lead to very abnormal and incorrect results

### Noise
> Noise refers to modification of original values, Ex: distortion of a person’s voice when talking on a poor phone and “snow” on television screen.

### Outliers
> Outliers are data objects with characteristics that are considerably  different than most of the other data objects in the data set, sometimes the goal is to detect outliers like in examples of financial fraud.

### Missing Values
> Missing values may happen if certain data isn't collected or where attributes aren't applicable to all cases (e.g. children don't have income unless they yearn for the mines)

A couple ways we can handle missing values is by eliminating data objects/attributes, estimating missing values, or ignore the missing value during analysis.
### Duplicate Data
