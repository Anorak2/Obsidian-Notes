# Supervised Learning

## Setup
Given a collection of records (Training set) each character needs to be characterized as an (x,y) pair. X represents the feature, attribute, or independent variable whereas Y represents the target, label, or dependent variable.

**Goal:** Learn a model function so that f(x) ca correctly predict $\hat y$ for the corresponding value of y

**tasks:** Use regression to predict a continuous value for $\hat y$ and classification to predict a category class $\hat y$
