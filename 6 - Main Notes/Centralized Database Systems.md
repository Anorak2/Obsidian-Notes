# Centralized Database Systems

Centralized database systems are ones that run on a single computer system which can be either for a single user or a multi-user system that could serve many users.

**Benefits
- Centralized control makes it easier to enforce **data integrity** rules, ensuring that the data is accurate, valid, and consistent across the entire database
- Data is typically stored only once, minimizing **data redundancy** and the associated inconsistencies and update anomalies
- A centralized system allows for **centralized security** management, making it easier to control access to the database and protect sensitive data

**Downsides**
- Performance gets worse as it grows
- There's a high cost to maintain large centralized DBs
- Reliability problems
