It's often very useful or needed to transform a Random value into one or more derived RVs by math functions


**One Derived DRV from one DRV**
for the DRV G, the PMF of D = m(g) is:

$$P_D(d) = \sum_{g:m(0)=d}P_G(g)$$
What we are saying is that the sum the probabilities of all g that map into a given d, and that mapping can also be many to 1

**One Derived DRV from two DRVs**

$$P_D(d) = \sum_{(g,h):m(g,h)=d} P_{G,h}(g,h)$$
