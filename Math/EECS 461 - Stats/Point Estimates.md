**Properties**
Some of the properties of point estimates include bias, consistency, and accuracy

The sample mean is an unbiased and consistent estimator, although the sample variance by comparison is a biased estimator of a random variable.

**Consistency Estimator**
the sequence of estimates $\hat R$ of parameter r are consistent if for any $\epsilon > 0$ 

$$\lim_{n \to \infty}P[|\hat R_n -r| \leq \epsilon] = 0$$
**Bias**
an estimate $\hat R$ is unbiased if $E[\hat R ]=r$, otherwise $\hat R$ is biased

**Mean Square Error**
the mean square error for an estimator $\hat R$ of parameter r is 
$$e=E[(\hat R-r)^2]$$
Something to note is that when $\hat R$ is an unbiased estimator and $E[\hat R] = r$ the mean square error is the variance of R.
