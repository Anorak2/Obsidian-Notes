# ARP
The Address Resolution Protocol is used to fix the problem of how do we determine an interfaces MAC address knowing it's IP address? The solution is the ARP table, which stores every IP node and it's respective MAC address mapping. It also stores these with a TTL after which the mapping will be forgotten, often set to 20 minutes.
