# WPA 3
WPA 3 is the newest version that is meant to provide cutting edge security. According to the WiFi alliance all WPA3 networks use the latest security methods and disallow outdated protocols, as well as require the use of Protected Memory Frames (PMF). WPA 3 also has protections against offline dictionary attacks and forward secrecy.
