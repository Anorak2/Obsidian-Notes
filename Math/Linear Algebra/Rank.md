if we have a matrix, that can be rectangular. We can obtain an r minor by deleting m-r rows and n-r columns from A which gets us a square matrix. $|M| = a-r$, the r minor of A

rank(A) = Max{r : there is an r minor r such that |M| != 0 }

if we suppose A is a $n*n$ matrix, if:
- A is non-singular, then rank(A) = r
- A is singular, then rank(A) < n
- A != 0, then rank(A) >= 1
