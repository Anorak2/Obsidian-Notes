this is what we're talking about with $f^{(n)}$

#### Direction of change
if f'(x) > 0  on an interval then f is increasing on that interval

if f'(x) < 0  on an interval then f is decreasing on that interval

#### Concavity
f(x) is concave **up** on(a,b) if the graph of f is above the the tangent line at every point in (a,b)

f(x) is concave **down** on(a,b) if the graph of f is below the the tangent line at every point in (a,b)

#### Concave and second derivative
f''(x) is concave **up** on(a,b) then f is concave up on (a,b)

f''(x) is concave **down** on(a,b) then f is concave down on (a,b)
