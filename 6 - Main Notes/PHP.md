# PHP

PHP is a server side scripting language designed specifically for the web, and it allows for certain things like embedding PHP inside of an HTML page that is executed each time the page is loaded. PHP is interpreted at the web server and generates HTML and other output the viewer sees. As a result it does require a server like Apache.

**What it can do**
- Server side scripting
- Command line scripting
- Writing client side GUI applications, it is honestly bad for this
