# Integrals
An Integral is a way to measure the area of the function "under the curve", with the parts of the function above the x-axis counting as positive and the parts below counting as negative.  

## Integral Techniques
**UV methods**
$$ \int u \space dv= uv - \int v \space du$$
I mean it's the u/v method, when doing this make sure you make "similar" choices.  What I mean is if you use something as the derivative, keep doing that otherwise things may break.

**Partial Fractions**

**Trig Substitution**
There are several forms that have been proven to be equivalent and by substituting one function for another we can sometimes simplify our functions further

with these forms we can substitute in a trig function in the same way where we would sub something in with u sub.
$$\sec^2\theta = \tan^2\theta+1$$ $$\sin^2\theta = 1-\cos^2\theta$$ $$\tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta-1$$
