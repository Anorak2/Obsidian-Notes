Given an event E with P[E] > 0, we can form the univariate/bivariate conditional PMF/PDF simply by:
- Dividing the original PMF/PDF by P[E] AND
- Changing the range to be the original range intersected with E

What's interesting is that no matter how long you wait for something to happen, at any given moment the probability is still the Expected value 
**1 VAR PMF**
$$P_{G|E}(g) = P[(G=g)|E]= \frac{P_G(g)}{P[E]} $$

With the range of $S_{G|E} = S_G \cap E$ 
**2 VAR PMF**
$$P_{G|E}(g) = P[(G=g)|E]= \frac{f_{GH}(g,h)}{P[E]} $$
With the range of $S_{(G,H)|E} = S_{GH} \cap E$
