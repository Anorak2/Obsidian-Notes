We want to know when things are happening, when they aren't, and when they're broken. 

**Email**
Email notifications are really easy to use, and in the [[Flow Designer|flows]] it was pretty simple to use. Rather than send a boring looking email, as usual you can embed html inside of an email and also create templates that get applied to whatever emails you want. Useful links include System Mailboxes > Outbound > Outbox and System Notification > Email > Notifications

**How to**
When sending a notifications the three main things are when to send it, who will receive it, and what it will contain.
