# Rolle's Theorem and the mean value theorem
### Rolles Theorem
If there is a function where it is continuous on [a,b] and is differentiable on (a,b) and f(a) = f(b). Then there must be a value c in (a,b) such that f'(c) = 0. Phrased differently this means that there is a tangent line such that it is tangent to the secant line of (a,b)

### Mean Value Theorem
Suppose that a function is (I) continuous on [a,b] and (II) is differentiable on (a,b). 

Then there exists a value c in (a,b) such that f'(c) = $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$


# First Derivative Test
if c is a critical number of a continous function f

1. if f' changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a local maximum at c
2. if f' changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a local minimum at c
3. if f' does not change sign at c, then c is not a local extremum
