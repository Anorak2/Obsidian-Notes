So some [[Turing Machines]] will halt on some inputs, and this can just be due to the nature of the machine and its input. We actually cannot tell if a machine will halt until we run it and find out, or prove that it must finish.

- If a TM halted on every input that's essentially an algorithm
- Total Function - a function that has a TM that always halts
- Partial Function - a function that has a TM that fails on some inputs
- A language for which there is a TM that always halts (either rejecting or accepting its input) is known as a Turing-decidable language (recursive language)
- A language recognized by a TM that does not halt on every input is known as a Turing-recognizable language (recursively enumerable language)
