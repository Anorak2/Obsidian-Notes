### Definite Integral of a Function

**if it's integrable:**
if f is continuous on [a,b], or if f has only a finite number of jump discontinuities, then f is integrable on [a,b]

The definite integral calculates **net area**; the area below the positive part of the graph minus the area below the negative part.

### Integral Comparison

![[integral comp 3.png]]
One and two simply put mean that if a function is always bigger than another function then the integral is always bigger than the other integral. Comp property 3 just means that if the function is bounded the integral is also bounded

# Indefinite Integral

An anti-derivative of a function is a function F(x) such that:

$F'(x) = f(x)$

when we do the anti derivative we always add a constant c because the constant could be anything.

if F and G are both anti-derivatives of f(x) then g(x) = F(x) + c, n where c is some constant


### Inverse power rule
if we have $x^n$ we first add one to the exponent to get $x^{n+1}$ and then divide by the exponent to get:
$$\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$$

if we have $x^{-1}$ we must do the absolute value of natural log instead since we can't divide by 0.

for $a^x$ it becomes
$$ \frac{a^x}{ln(a)}+c$$
