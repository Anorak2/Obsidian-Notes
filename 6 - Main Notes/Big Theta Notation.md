# Big Theta Notation

Big theta notation is like [[Big O Notation]], except while Big(O) is kind of like $\leq$ big Theta is like equals

One approach to Finding:
- Choose a representative function and find [[Measuring Computing Cost|C(N)]] for how many times it occurred 
- determine the order of growth. Ex: if an operation takes constant time then $C(N) \in \theta(F(1))$ 
- You can use [[Big O Notation]] as an alternative for an upper bounds
