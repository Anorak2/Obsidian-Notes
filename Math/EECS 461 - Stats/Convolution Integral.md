**Common Special Case, Sum of independent RVs**
In this case, the joint PDF is the product of the [[Marginal RVs|marginals]] so we get:

$$f_K(k) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}f_G(g)f_H(k-g)\space dg$$
This is mentioned in [[Deriving one CRV from two CRVs]], but it gets its own slide since this is an enormous fucking pain in the ass to deal with.
