[[Theory of Computing]]

We have [[Formal Languages]], and what we can also do is operations over the elements within a language
Suppose
$$x = bab, y = abbaab$$
We can then perform operations over these variables
- length: $|x|=3$
- Concatenation: $xy=bababbaab$
- Repetition: $x^3 = babbabbab$, $x^0 = \lambda$
- Reversal: $y^R=baabba$ 
- Kleene Star: $x^* = \{ \lambda, bab, babbab, ...\}$ 

All of the usual things about set theory apply to languages and we can use that same $\cup, \cap$ sort of set theory terminology
