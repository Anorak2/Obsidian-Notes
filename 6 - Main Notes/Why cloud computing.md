# Why cloud computing

## Pro's
Cost: You can avoid the initial costs associated with starting a data center

Startup time: Since you are renting hardware you can very quickly or even dynamically buy more computing power as you need it which allows for a lot of elasticity

Server choice: If the servers that you are renting aren't strong enough or aren't in a good location you can pretty easily rent different ones

Distributed development: its beneficial to have the whole team working on the exact same instance and for changes to be instantly reflected

Security: Security can be hard to do and cloud providers take it very seriously, so if their people are better than yours it can lead to more secure systems

Remote Servers: Remote servers are cool since VMs allow for multiple different virtual servers to run on the same server. 

## Cons
Black Box: nothing inside of the cloud is visible to clients

Losing Control: Clients have no control over what happens inside of the cloud

Security: There's a number of traditional problems with things like confidentiality and also certain types of attacks

Performance and uptime: downtime can really impact a clients bottom line
